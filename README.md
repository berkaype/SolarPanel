calculates:
1-Solar Power Requirement
2-Panel Efficiency
3-Panel Capacity
4-Device Charging time

I made this program for my camping trip, I have a solar power utility, I just wanted to now how many devices I can connect at the same time without compromising the charge speeds and how much time would the a single charge on each device!
