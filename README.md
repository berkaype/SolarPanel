calculates: 

1-Solar Power Requirement

2-Panel Efficiency

3-Panel Capacity

4-Device Charging Time

I made this program for my camping trip. I have a solar power utility, and I just wanted to know how many devices I can connect at the same time without compromising the charging speeds and how much time would a single charge take on each device!
